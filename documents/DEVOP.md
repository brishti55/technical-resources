This is a collaborative program that includes topics ranging from Unix fundamentals to software development. The topics are often broken down in 101 (beginners), 201 (intermediate) and 301 (advanced) levels. The 101 lessons would be appropriate if you are just getting started. They also create videos that are published online by Oâ€™Reilly. 

There are tools such as Vagrant and Ansible that can make software deployment easier by automating different steps in the process.
