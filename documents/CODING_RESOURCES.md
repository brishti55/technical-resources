## Learning about Programming Languages 

### Difference Between Procedural and Object-oriented Programming
Procedural programming languages do everything by following step-by-step instructions or procedures, which means you can understand what a particular piece of code is doing by referring back to previous pieces of code. Object oriented programming works in a more modular way where each object is meant to perform a specific task and any object can be called to perform that task from any section of the program.

### Major programming languages and tutorials 

**Procedural Programming Language**

**C** is one of the most widely used and powerful system programming languages applied in advanced software development. It is a low-level procedural language, and a major rival of Java, both constantly fighting for no. 1 place. 

**Object Oriented Programming Language**

* **C++** is a general purpose programming language. It was developed later and a superset of C, which means it can run most of C code. C++ is a hybrid language supporting both procedural and object oriented programming. While it was designed for system programming, it has strong applications in software development and resource constrained applications. C++ influenced development of other languages, such as C#, Java etc.

* **Java** is another popular programming language used by developers for creating applications - both computer software and client-server web applications. It is a class-based and object oriented general purpose language with similar syntax to C and C++. 

* **Ruby** is an high-level object oriented programming language, which is gaining more popularity now-a-days for its simple syntax yet high functionality. It is popular in web application development which is made easier with the different frameworks that are available such as Ruby on Rails. 

#### Hybrid

* **Python** is a high-level programming language used for general purpose programming but its syntax is less verbose than C++ or Java, which makes it a great fit for new beginners. It features multiple programming paradigms including object oriented, imperative and procedural styles. Python has varied uses for different purposes - it is widely used for scientific computing, especially data manipulation, such as data cleaning, natural language processing, data analysis, visualization etc. 

* **PHP** is a server side scripting language. Though it was mainly developed for web development, it is general purpose programming language as well. The object oriented functionality was later introduced in PHP, which became fully functional with PHP5. Its main application is in developing dynamic web pages but also used for server side programming.

* **Perl** is another multi-paradigm programming language being both procedural and object oriented. It is a high-level and general-purpose language which is heavily used for text processing, graphics programming, network programming etc. 

#### Statistical Programming Language 

* **R** is an open source language and software environment for statistical programming and graphics. It is extensible using different libraries made available for specific purposes. R is widely used for data manipulation, calculation tasks, including data import, cleaning, analysis and visualization. Ease of use, yet being effective with intermediate tools for statistical analysis make this a favorite tool in the field of data analytics. 

#### Scripting Language

* **JavaScript (JS)** is a programming language that is most widely known for running inside all modern web browsers. It, along with HTML and CSS, makes up the most common technologies used in World Wide Web content development. It is commonly used in websites to manage information, make requests for data, and dynamically alter the contents of a webpage without reloading it. JavaScript can now also be used as a server side language thanks to Node.js, a Javascript runtime that implements Googleâ€™s V8 engine (used to execute JS in Chrome) on the server.

#### Query Language

* **SQL** (short for Structured Query Language) is used for managing and manipulating data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS), such as MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, etc.

* **SPARQL** (recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a query language for Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a labeled graph data format for representing information in the Web. The syntax of SPARQL is similar to SQL, suited for retrieving relationships from triples (subject-predicate-object relationships).
